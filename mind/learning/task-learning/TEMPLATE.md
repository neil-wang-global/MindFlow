# Task Learning Record Template

This file defines the fixed structure of task-level learning records.

## File Naming Rule

- file path: `mind/learning/task-learning/tl-{task-id}.md`
- `{task-id}` must match the source task

## Fixed Structure

```md
# Task Learning Record

## Task ID
- source task ID

## Task Summary
- what this task did
- what result it produced

## External Acquisition

A task may trigger `Learning(Acquire)` multiple times (once per Step that encounters a knowledge gap, plus once if `reflection-report.md` flags `Requires External Acquisition: yes`). Each trigger is a separate acquisition event. All events must be listed individually.

If no external sources were acquired during this task, write:
- Status: `none`

Otherwise, list one entry per acquisition event:

### ACQ-{NNN}: {trigger description}

- **Trigger**: which Step or reflection trigger initiated this acquisition
- **Status**: `completed` or `exhausted`
- **Verification Report**: `tasks/{task-id}/acquire/verification-report.md` §ACQ-{NNN} (all events share one file; each event has its own section)
- **Passed Sources**: list of src-{NNN} IDs cleared for use (write `none` if exhausted)
- If `exhausted`:
  - **Reason**: why all sources failed (inaccessible, content mismatch, etc.)
  - **Impact**: how the absence of grounded sources affects the learning candidates from `reflection-report.md`
  - when `exhausted`, any `Candidate Knowledge` that depended on this event must list `Derived Conclusion: none — ACQ-{NNN} exhausted` and must not be promoted

## Candidate Knowledge

(If `reflection-report.md` has no learning candidates, write `none` as the only content under this heading.)

Otherwise, each candidate knowledge item must include a source anchor. Items without a valid source anchor are invalid and must not be promoted.

**Source verification requirement**: `Original Excerpt` must be a verbatim quote from the source file. The source file must be read (not recalled from memory) when writing the excerpt. The review stage will verify this via substring match against the actual file content.

### [KDC-{NNN}] Candidate Knowledge Title

**Source Type**: `grounded-external` or `task-output`

For `grounded-external`:
- **Acquisition Event**: ACQ-{NNN} (must reference one of the events listed under `External Acquisition`)
- **Grounded Source**: `tasks/{task-id}/acquire/raw-sources/src-{NNN}-{slug}.md`
- **Verification Status**: must be `passed` (confirmed in the verification report of the referenced ACQ-{NNN})
- **Original Excerpt**: > "verbatim quote copied directly from the raw source file — must be read from file, not recalled from memory"
- **Derived Conclusion**: the conclusion drawn from the above excerpt — written only after Original Excerpt is set

For `task-output`:
- **Source Anchor**: `tasks/{task-id}/_output/{filename}.md §{Section}` or `tasks/{task-id}/cache/{filename}.md §{Section}`
- **Original Excerpt**: > "verbatim quote copied directly from the output or cache file — must be read from file, not recalled from memory"
- **Derived Conclusion**: the conclusion drawn from the above excerpt — written only after Original Excerpt is set

## Potential Capability Impact
- which `Capability` may be affected

## Next Promotion Target
- target draft file path
- write `none` if nothing should be promoted
```

## Validation Rules

- `Task ID` must not be omitted
- `External Acquisition` must not be omitted; if any acquisition occurred, every event must be listed as a separate ACQ-{NNN} entry
- `exhausted` must not be used to silently suppress learning; the `Impact` sub-field must explain what knowledge could not be grounded and why
- every item under `Candidate Knowledge` must have a `Source Type`, a source anchor field, an `Original Excerpt`, and a `Derived Conclusion`
- `Original Excerpt` must be a verbatim quote copied directly from the source file at write time — recalling from memory is not permitted; the source file must be read before the excerpt is written
- for `grounded-external` items, the `Acquisition Event` field must reference an existing ACQ-{NNN} entry in this file
- for `grounded-external` items, the cited `src-{NNN}` must appear in the `Passed Sources` list of the referenced ACQ-{NNN}
- `Candidate Knowledge` must not be omitted
- `Potential Capability Impact` must not be omitted
- `Next Promotion Target` must not be omitted
- for `grounded-external` items, the `ACQ-{NNN}` label referenced in `Acquisition Event` must match a corresponding entry in `state.md §Learning(Acquire) Log`; if the labels are inconsistent, terminal Learning must pause and report the mismatch before proceeding
- if the corresponding `reflection-report.md` contains non-empty `Learning Candidates`, then `Next Promotion Target` must not be `none` — it must point to at least one `draft-*.md` target; writing `none` when the reflection has identified learning candidates is a protocol violation and must not occur silently; if promotion is genuinely not possible, the reason must be stated explicitly in a `Promotion Suppressed Reason` field; a valid suppression reason includes: all grounded-external candidates were blocked because every relevant ACQ-{NNN} event returned `exhausted` (zero passed sources) — in this case, write `Promotion Suppressed Reason: ACQ-{NNN} exhausted — no verifiable sources available` and do not fabricate alternatives
